## Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at McGill University.  
My research focuses on development economics, structural transformation and economics growth, with an emphasis on understanding how labor allocation, comparative advantage, and sectoral productivity gaps shape income inequality in developing economies.

My job market paper studies the impact of self-selection based on comparative advantages on sectoral productivity gaps in Indonesia before the "Big Bang" decentralization. The subsequent paper further studies the role of the selection effect on productivity gaps after the decentralization.

You can find my full CV [here](cv/cv.pdf).
