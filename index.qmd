## Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at McGill University.  
My research focuses on **development economics**, **economic growth**, and **structural transformation**, with an emphasis on understanding how labor allocation, comparative advantage, and sectoral productivity gaps shape income inequality in developing economies.

My current work quantifies the role of **individual sorting on unobserved comparative advantage** in explaining earnings gaps between agriculture and non-agriculture in Indonesia, combining microdata from the IFLS with structural models of sectoral choice.

You can find my full CV [here](cv/cv.pdf).
